        <h1>My message sent to ____@randalllowe.com was reported bounced. Why?</h1>

        <p>This domain has transferred hands after 4 years of unregistration. It is now owned by a College Student based in California and will continue to be owned by said student for the forseeable future.</p>
        
		<h2>Has any of my messages made it to their intended recipient?</h2>

        <p>Unfortunately, probably not.</p>
        <p>Until recently, I have not decided to use this domain for email, but upon receiving email that was clearly not for me, I've been trying to stop receiving these emails.</p>
		<p>ALL emails that were not intended for me have been deleted, and are to be considered not received by the appropiate party</p>
		
        <h3>What can I do? (Or more likely, "What went wrong?")</h3>

        <p>More than likely, based on a cursory glance of the emails, you were trying to contact the Randal Lowe Plumbing Company based in Marietta, GA (2,500 miles away)</p>
		<p>Their website is based @ <a href=http://www.randallowe.com>randallowe.com</a> (With 2 l's, not 3).</p>
		<p>Try emailing your contact again, remembering to change the mislead domain from RandallLowe.com to RandalLowe.com instead</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Other than that, it is hard to determine who you are trying to reach, and unfortunately I cannot help further.</p>
		<p>If you need to contact me regarding your email, you can send an email to <a href="https://assets.rslowe.net/mailhide/email.html?mailKey=nN7htQoRV8whnQ8A0UZt" onclick="window.open('https://assets.rslowe.net/mailhide/email.html?mailKey=nN7htQoRV8whnQ8A0UZt', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">d...</a>@glaceon.org</p>
